the endpoint of the dungeon:

  a pit, maybe as small as 10x10x10, with its volume randomly filled with approx. 12 parts air block per 1 part diamond ore block.
  
  at the bottom of the pit, a button. Pressing it teleports you out of the pit, but you lose everything in your inventory.

upon reaching the end, you arrive at the top of the pit. You are now free to mine all the floating diamond blocks randomly scattered
 within the volume of the pit. Mine too many, though, and you will destroy your parkour path back to the top. Exiting from the top is
 the only way to keep all the diamonds you've mined.
